# ViKnow

Viknow is an application built to assist waiters and waitresses in suggesting food/wine pairings for customers. The application uses the Snooth Food and Wine API to fetch food and wine pairings, while the Typeahead.js library is used to provide real-time auto-complete and auto-suggest functionality to users based on their input.
